Ruby tools for generating random personal data for test environments etc.

The lib directory includes .txt files that contain sample data for
German locations or German languae, respectively.

name.rb
  Generates people names. This does not only generate simple combinations
  of one first and one last name, but also considers configurable
  likelihood of double given names ("Karl-Heinz"), double surnames
  ("MÃ¼ller-Schmitz"), and titles ("Prof. Dr.").
  Default files with German names are included:
  * givennamelist.txt
  * surnamelist.txt

address.rb
  Generates postal addresses, utilizing data files with street names
  and town names including postal code. Default files are included:
  * streetnamelist.txt
    contains fictive street names in German language.
  * postaltownlist.txt
    contains a list of all German postal codes and the corresponding
    town names.

email.rb
  Generate random email addresses. With regards to netiquette it is
  possible to avoid domains that the random domain is an existing
  email domain.

phone.rb
  Generates German phone numbers.
  
person.rb
  Wraps personal data (name, address, phone, email address) into
  a class.
