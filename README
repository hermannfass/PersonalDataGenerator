Ruby tools for generating random personal data, e.g. to be used for system
tests.

The lib directory contains all that is needed, i.e. the Ruby code and some
text data files. Names and postal codes are German, but the data files can be
replaced by any other data sets. The formats are self-explaining.

Documentation in the 'doc' directory was generated with RDoc.
