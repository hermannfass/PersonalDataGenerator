Ruby tools for generating random personal data for test environments etc.

Note that the Gem is currently not kept up to date, so you might
better copy the files from the lib directory to an appropriate
location on your system.

The lib directory contains, beside the Ruby code (.rb) also some
text files (.txt) with sample data for German locations or German language,
respectively.

name.rb
  Parse and generates people names, considering also combined given
  names, double surnames, and academic titles.
  Default files with German names are included:
  * givennamelist.txt
  * surnamelist.txt

address.rb
  Generates postal addresses, utilizing data files with street names
  and town names including postal code. Default files are included:
  * streetnamelist.txt
    contains fictive street names in German language.
  * postaltownlist.txt
    contains a list with towns and the corresponding postal codes.

email.rb
  Generate random email addresses.

phone.rb
  Generates German phone numbers.
  
person.rb
  Wraps personal data (name, address, phone, email address) into
  a class.
